title: Textual builds
description: In which you may download free builds of the excellent IRC client, Textual.

You may be familiar with the excellent IRC client for Mac OS X known as <a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a>. Unfortunately, it's only available in the app store, and the app store version is sandboxed -- so your logs are in a black hole somewhere and it's a pain to install custom styles.

Luckily, Textual is BSD-licensed, so there's nothing stopping someone from creating and distributing their own builds. So without further ado, I present a non-sandboxed build of Textual that doesn't suck.
