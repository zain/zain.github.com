title: Textual builds
description: In which you may download free builds of the excellent IRC client, Textual.
---

You may be familiar with the excellent IRC client for Mac OS X known as <a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a>. Unfortunately, it's only available in the app store, and the app store version is sandboxed -- so your logs are in a black hole somewhere and it's a pain to install custom styles.

Luckily, Textual is BSD-licensed, so there's nothing stopping someone from creating and distributing their own builds. So without further ado, I present a non-sandboxed build of Textual that doesn't suck.

Also, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textual-irc-client/id403012667?mt=12">buy this from the app store</a> to support the author.
